    <h1 class="article__titre">Xavier Dolan</h1>
    <p class="article__chapo">Through his films, Xavier Dolan has often captured the fragility of human relationships. His obsession with family, identity, and generational conflicts makes him a unique observer of the 21st-century world.</p>
    <p class="article__legende">By Victor Landwerlin</p>
    <div class="article__carre"></div>
    <p class="article__texte">Xavier Dolan is a director who marked the beginning of the 21st century. Born in 1989, he made his first film, I Killed My Mother, at just 20 years old. From this first feature film, he delves into tense family relationships, particularly between a mother and her son. This theme quickly becomes an obsession in his work.</p>

    <p class="img__legende">Xavier Dolan</p>
    <p class="article__texte">Dolan is not only behind the camera. He also acts in his films. This dual role allows him to perfectly control what he wants to show: raw emotions, frustrations that explode. He often surrounds himself with the same actors, creating a real dynamic on his sets.</p>
    <p class="article__texte">In 2014, his film Mommy caused a sensation. It tells another difficult mother-son relationship. At the time, such stories resonated with many people. Families were often rigid, roles well-defined. Such family tensions, with impossible expectations, now seem almost exaggerated.</p>

    <p class="img__legende">Poster of Mommy by Xavier Dolan</p>
    <p class="article__texte">In 2016, Dolan adapted It's Only the End of the World, a work by Jean-Luc Lagarce. The book and the play are monuments on the theme of family. Dolan, true to his style, accentuates the silences, the screams, and especially the impossibility of communication. Nowadays, such family blockages seem very distant.</p>
    <p class="article__texte">Today, families are more open, less suffocating. In Dolan's films, we see characters fighting to be heard by their parents, but failing. These struggles, where acceptance seems unattainable, appear outdated in our modern societies. Now, individuals choose who they want in their lives.</p>

    <p class="img__legende">Xavier Dolan behind the camera</p>
    <p class="article__texte">Dolan has always sought to capture those moments when everything explodes. He films very closely, every emotion is palpable. But nowadays, family dramas are less frequent. People communicate better, and the biological family no longer has the weight it once had.</p>
    <p class="article__texte">Xavier Dolan remains a witness of his time. He captures family conflicts that we almost struggle to recognize today. His cinema reflects a time when family pressure was enormous. Now, this pressure has largely disappeared, and the tensions he depicts belong to the past.</p>
